**miniAI** is a feed-forward neural network built entirely in pure C — no ML libraries, no dependencies.

Features backpropagation, custom arena memory management, PNG image processing, and automated hyperparameter optimization.

Also ships with a robust CI/CD system for multi-platform builds, automated releases, and Docker support.
